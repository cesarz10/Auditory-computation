    "Here, we will make use of the event-related potentials (EEG) to a sensory event. We use multiple repetitions to the same event to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the data. We will use this information to perform bootstrapping-based hypothesis testing. In the first part, you will process your own recorded auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), which were recorded to 3000 repetitions of an acoustic click. The resulting signal has a very typical waveform with distinct peaks which occur within the first 10 ms after the click onset, and which resemble different processing stages along the auditory pathway. The peak at 1-2 ms (wave-I) reflects the ensemble of auditory-nerve fibers available, whereas the peak at 5-7 ms (wave-V) reflects the brainstem processing of sound (inferior colliculus). The ABR is hence some sort of impulse response of the ear, and is often clinically used to detect peripheral brain lesions, or as a screening tool for neonates. The signal also has information about how the ear processes sound (i.e. for research purposes).\n",
